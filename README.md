# AvesAID - Autopilot for Inspection Drones

AvesAID is a specialized autopilot system designed specifically for complex inspection missions and scenarios. Built on the robust PX4 foundation, AvesAID extends the capabilities with advanced payload management, real-time adaptation, and inspection-focused flight control features.

This repository contains the AvesAID flight control solution, with customized modules located in the [src/modules](src/modules) directory. AvesAID includes specialized middleware and drivers optimized for inspection drone operations.

AvesAID is highly portable, OS-independent and supports Linux, NuttX and MacOS out of the box.

## Key Features

* **Advanced Payload Management**: Real-time payload monitoring and rotor position adaptation
* **Inspection-Optimized Flight Control**: Specialized flight modes for complex inspection scenarios
* **Dynamic Effectiveness Matrix**: Real-time actuator effectiveness adaptation based on payload status
* **Custom MAVLink Commands**: Extended command set for inspection-specific operations
* **Configurable Transitions**: Smooth, parameterized transitions for payload deployment and retraction
* **PX4 Convention Versioning**: Git tag format v<PX4-version>-<AvesAID-version> (e.g., v1.15.4-1.0.0)

## Supported Inspection Scenarios

* **Infrastructure Inspection**: Bridges, towers, buildings, pipelines
* **Surface Preparation**: Advanced surface treatment with attachable tools
* **Non-Destructive Testing**: Ultrasonic, magnetic, and visual inspection systems
* **Precision Positioning**: High-accuracy positioning for detailed inspection work
* **Multi-Payload Operations**: Support for various inspection payloads and sensors

## Supported Inspection Payloads

AvesAID supports a wide range of inspection equipment:

| Payload Type | Applications |
|---|---|
| **Cameras & Imaging** | Visual inspection, thermal imaging, multispectral analysis |
| **Ultrasonic Testing** | Non-destructive material testing, thickness measurement |
